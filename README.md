# Hi, I’m Tennille Bernard!

I’m a digital product and program leader with a background in scaling enterprise solutions at Fortune 100 companies—and I’m now diving deep into the world of AI/ML.

Hi! If you've made it this far, welcome to my first offical Github. I'm still learning how to navigate this space, so if I make an error, please bear with me.  
I'm currently wrapping up the Artificial Intelligence Deep Stack Bootcamp at Kal Academy (https://kalacademy.com/artificial-intelligence-deep-stack-bootcamp/) 

This GitHub showcases:
- Generative AI and machine learning projects
- End-to-end solutions with real business applications
- My growth as a leader at the intersection of data and strategy

Let’s connect and build the future of responsible tech.
