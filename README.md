# Kal-Academy-Modules
TL;DR: A portfolio of modules built in Kal Academy classes

Hi! If you've made it this far, welcome to my first offical Github. I'm still learning how to navigate this space, so if I make an error, please bare with me.  
In this space, I'll be uploading the code that we build in my Kal Academy Deep Stack Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp (https://kalacademy.com/artificial-intelligence-deep-stack-bootcamp/) as a way to showcase my skills.  
I'll host a separate folder for my assignments.  
Right now, all work is performed in Google Colab. Also, I tend to leave lots of comments in my work so that I can understand why I did what I did.  

Best,  
Tennille
